The contributors on this repository have experience in AI and also in helping governments in their National AI Strategies.

## Tell me more, How?
At the moment this is focussed on agents and LLM applications that are built on Ruby & Rails. It scans the source code automatically, detects for LLM related code and AI Prompts and uses a configuration files to run a AI Athics & Safety Ranking. 

## Features

- **Source Code Scanning**: Automatically scans and parses source code to identify AI prompts.

- **AI Prompt Analysis**: Evaluates AI prompts for compliance with ethical standards and safety protocols.

- **Benchmarking**: Uses advanced models to benchmark AI prompts against recognized AI ethics principles.
